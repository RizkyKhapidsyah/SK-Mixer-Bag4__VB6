Register It By Jamie Pocock : micracom2@hotmail.com 

 'The registar dll came from the web and was
 'written by Chris Roebuck. I have wrote the rest of the program.
    Useing this code you are able to register
ole,s......dll,s....ocx,s you find on the beloved W.W.W.
  'If you have any questions please feel free to email
      me at micracom2@hotmail.com my names jamie.
      p.s the coding is simple so I felt there was
      'little need to add explanation statements.

This is a vast improvement of my program I posted last mouth
